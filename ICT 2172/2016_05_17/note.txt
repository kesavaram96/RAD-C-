class:
*multiple variables may have a reference to the same object
*it is possible for  operations on one variable to effect the object
 reference by the other variable
*classes are reference types
*with classes multiple variables may have reference to the same object
*object of classes are stored within the heap memory and its reference 
will be maintain at the stack.


structure:
*the variables each have their own copy of the data and it is not 
possible for operations on one to effect the other

*structs do not support user specified inheritance and they implicitly 
inherit from type object.

*struct are value types and contain data and functions

*they do not require heap allocation

*they directly store their data int the stack

*constructors are invoked with the new operator but that does not allocate 
memory on the heap

*struct construct simply returns the struct value itself and this value 
is the copied as necessary
